# Mood_Tracking_App
 Here ,   I have made a basic mood tracking app  using Kotlin as a language and i have used room databse to store  the data .



 I have used Room database it provides an abstraction layer over the sqllite database  which makes easy  to perform crud in less code.
It contains Entity(table),database and dao(data access objects).



I have shown history in app using recycler view.
Adapter file is used to access recycler view in app.
